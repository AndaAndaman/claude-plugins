# Ship Command

Bump version, commit, and push in one step.

**IMPORTANT:** Execute steps sequentially. Do NOT skip steps. Do NOT combine steps. Complete each step fully before moving to the next.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Determine version

- If `[version]` is a semver (e.g. `1.2.3`), use it directly
- If `patch` (default): increment patch (0.7.0 → 0.7.1)
- If `minor`: increment minor (0.7.0 → 0.8.0)
- If `major`: increment major (0.7.0 → 1.0.0)

### Step 2: Find plugin to bump

Look at the git diff to determine which plugin(s) changed:
- Run `git diff --name-only` and `git diff --cached --name-only` to see all changes
- Check `plugins/*/src/` for modified files
- Read the plugin's `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for current version
- Also check `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` for the marketplace entry

If changes span multiple plugins, ask the user which one to bump.

### Step 3: Bump version in ALL version files

**MANDATORY** — Update ALL THREE files. Missing any causes version drift:

1. `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — `version` field
2. `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — matching plugin's `version` field
3. `plugins/<name>/src/main.ts` — version string in `new McpServer(...)` (MCP plugins only)

**Verify:** After editing, read all three files back to confirm versions match.

### Step 4: Build (if applicable)

If the plugin has a build step (check for `package.json` with `build` script):
```bash
cd plugins/<name> && npm run build
```

**MANDATORY:** Build MUST happen AFTER version bump so the dist includes the new version.

Verify the build succeeds (exit code 0). If it fails, fix the error before continuing.

### Step 5: Update README

Evaluate whether README updates are needed:

**MUST update** when:
- New tools/commands/agents added
- Tools/commands removed or renamed
- Tool parameters changed
- New workflows or usage patterns

**Skip** when:
- Bug fixes with no user-facing changes
- Internal refactoring
- Config tweaks

When updating:
- Update the root `README.md` tool lists, descriptions, and usage examples
- Update session-start hook if it documents available tools
- Keep changes minimal — only update sections affected by the code changes

### Step 6: Commit

Stage specific files (NEVER use `git add -A` or `git add .`):
- Changed source files
- Updated plugin.json and marketplace.json
- Built dist files (if any)
- Updated README/docs (if any)

Commit message:
- If `[message]` provided, use it as the commit message
- Otherwise auto-generate: `<summary of changes> (v<new-version>)`
- Always append: `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>`

### Step 7: Push

```bash
git push
```

If push fails (e.g. remote has new commits), run `git pull --rebase` then push again.

### Step 8: Report

Output exactly this format:
```
Shipped <plugin-name> v<version>
  Files: <count> changed
  Commit: <short-hash> <message>
  Pushed to origin/<branch>
```
