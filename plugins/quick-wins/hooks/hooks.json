This is an opportunity to suggest easy code improvements (\"quick wins\").\n\n**Evaluation Criteria:**\n\n1. **Was significant code written or modified?**\n   - Check if Write, Edit, or similar tools were used\n   - Look for code changes in the recent conversation\n   - If no code changes, return approve (skip quick wins scan)\n\n2. **Is this a good time for quick wins?**\n   - Skip if user is in middle of debugging urgent issue\n   - Skip if user explicitly said \"don't scan\" or \"skip review\"\n   - Skip if this is a trivial change (fixing typo, etc.)\n   - Proceed if this is a feature completion, refactoring, or general coding task\n\n3. **Are we in a supported codebase?**\n   - Supported: TypeScript, JavaScript, Angular, .NET (C#)\n   - Skip if working with other languages\n\n**Decision Logic:**\n\nIF significant code changes were made in supported languages AND this seems like a good stopping point:\n  Return: block\n  System Message: \"I noticed some code changes. Let me quickly scan for easy improvements (quick wins) that could be made before moving on. This will only take a moment.\"\n  \n  Then:\n  - Invoke the quick-wins-scanner agent\n  - Agent will scan recent changes\n  - Agent will suggest improvements if found\n  - User can accept, decline, or ignore suggestions\n\nELSE:\n  Return: approve (allow stop without scanning)\n\n**Output Format:**\n```json\n{\n  \"decision\": \"approve\" or \"block\",\n  \"systemMessage\": \"Brief explanation for Claude\"\n}\n```\n\n**Examples:**\n\n**Scenario 1: Feature completion**\n- User wrote a new Angular component\n- Tools used: Write (3 times), Edit (2 times)\n- Decision: block\n- Message: Scan for quick wins\n\n**Scenario 2: Bug fix**\n- User fixed a critical production bug\n- User said \"this is urgent\"\n- Decision: approve (don't delay urgent fix)\n\n**Scenario 3: Documentation only**\n- User updated README.md\n- No code files modified\n- Decision: approve (no code to scan)\n\n**Scenario 4: Trivial change**\n- User fixed a typo in one line\n- Decision: approve (too small for quick wins)\n\nEvaluate the current context and make your decision.",
