Quick wins scan recommended.\"\n}\n```\n\nOR\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ok\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"No code changes detected - skipping scan.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Field Definitions:**\n- `ok`: MUST be a boolean (true or false, not a string)\n  - `false` = block stop and trigger quick wins scan\n  - `true` = allow stop without scanning\n- `reason`: MUST be a string explaining your decision\n\n**Decision Logic:**\n\nIF (significant code changes in supported languages) AND (good stopping point) AND (not urgent/critical):\n  → Return {\"ok\": false, \"reason\": \"Brief explanation for why scan is needed\"}\n\nELSE:\n  → Return {\"ok\": true, \"reason\": \"Brief explanation for why scan is skipped\"}\n\n**CRITICAL:** Your response MUST be valid JSON only. Do not include any text before or after the JSON object.",
